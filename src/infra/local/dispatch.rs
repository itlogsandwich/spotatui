//! Local-file playback routing.
//!
//! This is the seam that keeps the Spotify [`Network`](crate::infra::network)
//! Spotify-only: [`route_playback_event`] is called from the runtime IoEvent
//! pump *before* `handle_network_event`. When the event targets local playback
//! (a `file://` URI, or any transport control while a local file owns the
//! session) it is handled here against the [`LocalPlayer`] and the event is
//! consumed; otherwise it falls through to the normal Spotify dispatch.
//!
//! ## Device ownership
//!
//! Only one backend holds the audio output device at a time (required on
//! exclusive-ALSA setups, harmless on PipeWire/PulseAudio/WASAPI):
//!
//! * Starting local playback first pauses native Spotify (librespot releases the
//!   device when its sink stops), then opens the local output device.
//! * Starting Spotify playback tears the local player down (dropping it releases
//!   the device) before the event is forwarded to the network.
