//! Native cross-source queue playback engine (Phase 2).
//!
//! Phase 1 built the queue *state* (`App::native_queue`, the Queue screen ops,
//! [`SuspendedContext`](crate::core::queue::SuspendedContext), persistence).
//! This module is the *engine* that consumes it: [`dispatch::route_queue_event`]
//! plays queued tracks through the shared decoded-audio sink, overlaying the
//! per-source playback contexts without mutating them, and resumes the
//! underlying context once the queue drains.
//!
//! ## Playback slot vs. suspended context
//!
//! [`QueueNowPlaying`] is what the queue slot is *currently* playing. It never
//! touches the per-source `*_playback` structs — those are the context to
//! resume, recorded in `App::queue_suspended`. When the suspended context is a
//! decoded source, the queue slot **reuses that context's `Arc<LocalPlayer>`**
//! (the sink is reloaded with the queued track); only when Spotify or nothing is
//! suspended does it open a fresh player. This keeps the "never two live players
//! on one output device" invariant.
